dart-rails_ujs
==============

### Idea

Provides basic ujs by dart for rails. This is mainly used and created because of [dart-rails](https://github.com/m0gg/dart-rails) gem.

### Setup

###### Add to pubspec.yaml

    dependencies:
      rails_ujs: any


and run `rake pub:get` if you have [dart-rails](https://github.com/m0gg/dart-rails) setup.
